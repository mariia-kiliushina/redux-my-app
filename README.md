This is a training React-app with a use of pure Redux with logger and thunk as a middleware.

There is an option with classic **connect** to pass state and dispatch actions to a component(src/components/buttons.js) and also
An option with **hooks** to fullfill these needs (src/components/hooksButtons.js)
